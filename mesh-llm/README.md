## Design

**mesh-llm owns :9337** — never llama-server directly. The API proxy peeks at the `model` field and routes to the right node.

**One model per node** — multi-model = different nodes serving different things. No VRAM double-commitment.

**Solo by default** — if a model fits (VRAM ≥ size × 1.1), it runs solo. Tensor split only when necessary.

**Latency-aware splitting** — when splitting is needed, peers sorted by RTT ascending. Take just enough for the VRAM shortfall. 80ms hard cap — high-latency nodes participate as API clients, not split partners.

**Demand-aware rebalancing** — request rates tracked per model, gossipped every 60s. Standby nodes promote when a model is hot (≥10 req/min, ≥3x imbalance vs coldest) or has zero servers.

**Event-driven** — death detected via tunnel failure + 60s heartbeat. Dead peers broadcast, not re-added by gossip. Cost proportional to topology changes, not node count.

**Passive scaling** — clients don't gossip, use routing tables only. Zero per-client state on servers.

## Nostr discovery

Opt-in. Without `--publish`, nothing touches Nostr.

```bash
# Publish
mesh-llm --model Qwen2.5-3B --publish --mesh-name "Sydney Lab" --region AU

# Discover
mesh-llm discover
mesh-llm discover --model GLM --region AU

# Auto-join (discover + join + serve)
mesh-llm --auto
```

Smart auto-join scores meshes by: name match, node count, model coverage, sticky preference, overload. QUIC health probe before committing. Publish watchdog auto-takes-over if the original publisher dies.

## Named meshes (buddy mode)

Create a shared mesh — everyone runs the same command:

```bash
mesh-llm --auto --model GLM-4.7-Flash-Q4_K_M --mesh-name "poker-night"
```

The first person to run it creates the mesh and starts serving. Everyone else discovers "poker-night" and joins automatically. `--mesh-name` implies `--publish` and strictly filters discovery to that name only — your group won't accidentally land in someone else's mesh.

## Idle mode

```bash
mesh-llm    # no args
```

Shows getting-started instructions and opens a read-only console on `:3131`. The node stays dormant — no inbound QUIC connections or heartbeat — until you start or join a mesh via CLI flags.

## InferenceHub onboarding

Use hub-managed onboarding (no local Nostr invite/discovery flow):

```bash
mesh-llm --inferencehub
mesh-llm --auto --inferencehub
mesh-llm --inferencehub --hub-mesh "my-public-mesh"
mesh-llm --inferencehub --hub-invite "ih_inv_..."
```

Then use `Login with InferenceHub` in the console header to link the current mesh or leave and join/create a mesh on InferenceHub.

## Live demo

**[Try it now](https://mesh-llm-console.fly.dev/)** — web console connected to the default public mesh. Runs as a client on Fly.io, no GPU.
